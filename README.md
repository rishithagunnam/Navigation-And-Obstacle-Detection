## Navigation-And-Obstacle-Detection
The Location-Based Navigation and Obstacle Detection System with Voice Alerts for Visually Impaired is an Arduino-powered smart assistive device designed to enhance mobility for visually impaired individuals. The system integrates ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, GPS for real-time location tracking, and GSM for emergency communication. When an obstacle is detected, the device triggers audio alerts to notify the user via a speaker or headphones. It can also send the current GPS coordinates to a predefined contact using GSM messaging. The device is built around an Arduino microcontroller, making it cost-effective and easy to customize. Voice modules are used to provide real-time feedback to the user about obstacles and location. The system aims to reduce dependency on others by enabling independent navigation. It includes a buzzer for short-range alerts and water sensors for wet surface detection. The stick-based design ensures minimal training and is portable for daily use. This project empowers visually impaired individuals to navigate safely and confidently.
